    "title": "Margaret Keane - Daughter",
    "paragraph": "Keane's paintings are recognized by the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects. Keane said she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature 'Keane eyes' when she started painting portraits of children. 'Children do have big eyes. When I'm doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger,' Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more. Keane attributed Amedeo Modigliani's work as a major influence on the way she painted women from 1959 on. Other artists who influenced her in terms of color, dimension, and composition include Vincent van Gogh, Gustav Klimt, and Pablo Picasso. Despite her claims to fine art, she was never a critical success."
